Conclusion & Recommendations

Churn is heavily influenced by short customer tenure, flexible contract terms, lack of value-added services, and payment methods.

	•	Bundle additional services (security, tech support, device protection) to add value.
	•	Target onboarding efforts at new customers, especially in their first 3 months.
	•	Focus on senior citizens with tailored offers.
	•	Address dissatisfaction among fiber optic customers.
	•	Promote alternative payment methods over electronic checks.
